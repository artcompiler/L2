Graffiti Code
=============

Graffiti Code is a syntax light language that borrows from the core semantics of ML. It is intended
for creative coding with a smart editor. The goal is to reduce the development cycle to Edit and Run,
eliminating, as much as possible, the need for debugging beyond simple console logging.

Features include:
- function definitions with overloading
- function invocation with pattern matching
- first class functions
- strong static typing
- type inference
- punctuation light syntax

## Sample Code ##

~~~
fun foo n =
    if n is zero then n.
    else print n. foo n minus one..
~~~

~~~
fun dance n = if n is zero then n else forward two seconds. spin right ninety degrees.
    backward two seconds. spin right ninety degrees. forward two seconds. spin left
    ninety degrees. forward two seconds. spin left ninety degrees. dance n minus one..

fun flash lights = blink 100 on off off. blink 100 off on off. 
    blink 100 off off on.. 

fun start = dance ten. flash lights..
~~~

NOTE: '.' terminates an expression. ',' terminates a sub-expression, which useful for resolving
parsing ambiguities. Two consecutive '.' terminates the current function definition.
